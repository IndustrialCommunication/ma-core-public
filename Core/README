Congratulations for downloading Mango.  Here are some tips to get you up and running as fast as possible.

For help installing see our Installation form: http://forum.infiniteautomation.com/forum/forums/show/20.page

*****Installation*****

Mango requires Java JDK 1.7 (also known as JDK 7) to be already installed on your system. Infinite Automation recommends using the Oracle JDK 7..  You may need to set a JAVA_HOME environmental variable pointing to your JDK install folder.

1.) Unzip the Mango zip file into any directory you like.  
2.) To start Mango Automation, run one of the scripts provided in the /bin folder, either ma-start.bat for Windows platforms or ma.sh for *nix or Mac. (Also note: for *nix you may have to run "chmod +x ma-start.sh" to make the script executable.) 
In addition, for *nix users ensure that the Mango home directory and all subdirectories are writable by the user under which Mango will run. 

To use the /bin/ma.sh script on your command line, change to the bin directory and then type ./ma.sh start or ./ma.sh stop

If you are having trouble starting Mango Automation:

1. Make sure you have Java JDK 1.7 installed.
2. JAVA_HOME is set to the Java JDK 1.7 install directory.  On windows usually: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_XX
3. Nothing else is using port 8080 or change Mango to run on a different port.  See the /classes/env.properties file to set the new port number, read the instructions on how to use the overrides directory.

If you still have trouble and you notice that script window briefly pops up and then the window closes: Open a command prompt and run mango from there so the window doesn't close.  Make a post in this forum with the results of the script and we will help you diagnose the issue.
