  Site analytics are used to track various statistics about your Mango pages.  There are 2 
  places that HTML or script tags can be inserted into Mango's pages.  The first is just before 
  the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag and the second is just before the closing &lt;/body&gt; tag.  The contents of 
  these will be placed at the corresponding location of <b>every</b> page in Mango.  When left blank, nothing is inserted.
