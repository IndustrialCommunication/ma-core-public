<h1>Overview</h1>

This page provides a fast way to apply <b>set</b> and <b>read</b> permissions to data points.  Data point groups can be filtered by creating 
filters to find desired points.

<h2>Creating a Filter</h2>

Filters are applied if the <b>Filter Enabled</b> column is set to true.  Multiple filters can be applied at the same time.  
Filters can use either % or * as wildcards, all other characters are treated as is.

Permissions can be applied by adding one or more groups separated by commas into the box and then clicking <b>Apply permissions</b>.  To clear all permissions for the 
points in view click the <b>Clear permissions</b> button.
