<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
This page provides a fast way to apply <b>set</b> and <b>read</b> permissions to data points.  Data point groups can be filtered by creating 
filters to find desired points.
</p>

<h2>Creating a Filter</h2>
<p>
Filters are applied if the <b>Filter State</b> column is not set to <i>Disabled</i>.  Multiple filters can be applied at the same time.  
Filters can use either % or * as wildcards, all other characters are treated as is.  Using the value <i>null</i> will match null values, but using the 
value <i>*null*</i> will match a string that contains the text 'null'.
</p>
<p>
Each Filter row can be applied as a boolean <i>And</i> or a boolean <i>Or</i> by setting the <b>Filter State</b> accordingly.  
<i>And</i> operations require a point to match all of the required filter parameters.  <i>Or</i> operators allow matching only one 
of the parameters.
</p>
<p>Each filter parameter can be disabled or enabled for the current request by checking the check box in the column header.  
Disabling the parameter excludes it from the query entirely. To edit the value of the filter parameter, click in the cell 
for the corresponding filter and start typing.  Hitting <i>enter</i> will close the editor and update the filter results.  
Filter cells <b>cannot</b> be edited if they are disabled.
</p>

<h2>Applying Permissions</h2>
<p>
Permissions can be applied by adding one or more groups separated by commas into the box and then clicking <b>Apply permissions</b>.  To clear all permissions for the 
points in view click the <b>Clear permissions</b> button.
