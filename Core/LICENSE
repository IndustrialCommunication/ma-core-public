Serotonin Software Mango Automation Terms of Service

These Terms of Service apply to the executable code version of Mango Automation. 

1. Your relationship with Serotonin
1.1 Your use of Serotonin’s products, software, services and web sites (referred to collectively as the “Services” in 
this document and excluding any services provided to you by Serotonin under a separate written agreement) is subject to 
the terms of a legal agreement between you and Serotonin. “Serotonin” means Serotonin Software Inc., whose principal 
place of business is at 90 Castleglen Blvd, Markham, Ontario, Canada. This document explains how the agreement is made 
up, and sets out some of the terms of that agreement.

1.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Serotonin, your agreement with Serotonin will always include, at a minimum, 
the terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to below as the “Universal Terms”. 

1.3 Your agreement with Serotonin will also include the terms set forth below in the Serotonin Mango Automation 
Additional Terms of Service and terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the Services, in addition to the Universal 
Terms. All of these are referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms apply to a Service, these 
will be accessible for you to read either within, or through your use of, that Service.

1.4 The Universal Terms, together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement between you and Serotonin 
in relation to your use of the Services. It is important that you take the time to read them carefully. Collectively, 
this legal agreement is referred to below as the “Terms”.

1.5 If there is any contradiction between what the Additional Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the 
Additional Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.

2. Accepting the Terms
2.1 In order to use the Services, you must first agree to the Terms. You may not use the Services if you do not accept 
the Terms.

2.2 You can accept the Terms by:
(A) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option is made available to you by Serotonin in the user 
interface for any Service; or

(B) by actually using the Services. In this case, you understand and agree that Serotonin will treat your use of the 
Services as acceptance of the Terms from that point onwards.

3. Provision of the Services by Serotonin
3.1 Serotonin is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible experience for its users. You acknowledge 
and agree that the form and nature of the Services which Serotonin provides may change from time to time without prior 
notice to you.

3.2 As part of this continuing innovation, you acknowledge and agree that Serotonin may stop (permanently or 
temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally at Serotonin’s 
sole discretion, without prior notice to you. You may stop using the Services at any time. You do not need to 
specifically inform Serotonin when you stop using the Services.

the Services, your account details or any files or other content which is contained in your account.

4. Use of the Services by you
4.1 You agree to use the Services only for purposes that are permitted by (a) the Terms and (b) any applicable law, 
regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding 
the export of data or software to and from Canada or other relevant countries).

4.2 You agree that you will not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts the Services (or the servers

4.4 You agree that you are solely responsible for (and that Serotonin has no responsibility to you or to any third 
party for) any breach of your obligations under the Terms and for the consequences (including any loss or damage which 
Serotonin may suffer) of any such breach.

5. Proprietary rights

5.1 You acknowledge and agree that Serotonin (or Serotonin’s licensors) own all legal right, title and interest in and 
to the Services, including any intellectual property rights which subsist in the Services (whether those rights happen 
to be registered or not, and wherever in the world those rights may exist).

5.2 Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Serotonin, nothing in the Terms gives you a right to use any of 
Serotonin’s trade names, trade marks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features.

5.3 Serotonin acknowledges and agrees that it obtains no right, title or interest from you (or your licensors) under 
these Terms in or to any Content that you submit, post, transmit or display on, or through, the Services, including any 
intellectual property rights which subsist in that Content (whether those rights happen to be registered or not, and 
wherever in the world those rights may exist). Unless you have agreed otherwise in writing with Serotonin, you agree 
that you are responsible for protecting and enforcing those rights and that Serotonin has no obligation to do so on 
your behalf.

5.4 You agree that you shall not remove, obscure, or alter any proprietary rights notices (including copyright and 
trade mark notices) which may be affixed to or contained within the Services.

5.5 Unless you have been expressly authorized to do so in writing by Serotonin, you agree that in using the Services, you 
will not use any trade mark, service mark, trade name, logo of any company or organization in a way that is likely or 
intended to cause confusion about the owner or authorized user of such marks, names or logos.

6. License from Serotonin
6.1 Serotonin gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the 
software provided to you by Serotonin as part of the Services as provided to you by Serotonin (referred to as the 
“Software” below). This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as 
provided by Serotonin, in the manner permitted by the Terms.

6.2 Subject to section 1.2, you may not (and you may not permit anyone else to) copy, modify, create a derivative work

unless this is expressly permitted or required by law, or unless you have been specifically told that you may do so by 
Serotonin, in writing.

6.3 Subject to section 1.2, unless Serotonin has given you specific written permission to do so, you may not assign (or

Software, or otherwise transfer any part of your rights to use the Software.

7. Content license from you
7.1 You retain copyright and any other rights you already hold in Content which you create on or through, the Services.

8. Software updates
8.1 The Software which you use may automatically download and install updates from time to time from Serotonin. These

deliver these to you) as part of your use of the Services.

9. Ending your relationship with Serotonin
9.1 The Terms will continue to apply until terminated by either you or Serotonin as set out below.

(A) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner which clearly shows that you do not intend 
to, or are unable to comply with the provisions of the Terms); or

(B) Serotonin is required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services to you is, or becomes, 
unlawful); or

(C) the partner with whom Serotonin offered the Services to you has terminated its relationship with Serotonin or 
ceased to offer the Services to you; or

9.3 Nothing in this Section shall affect Serotonin’s rights regarding provision of Services under Section 4 of the 
Terms.

9.4 When these Terms come to an end, all of the legal rights, obligations and liabilities that you and Serotonin have 
benefited from, been subject to (or which have accrued over time whilst the Terms have been in force) or which are 
expressed to continue indefinitely, shall be unaffected by this cessation, and the provisions of paragraph 14.7 shall 
continue to apply to such rights, obligations and liabilities indefinitely.

10. EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES
10.1 NOTHING IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING SECTIONS 10 AND 11, SHALL EXCLUDE OR LIMIT SEROTONIN’S WARRANTY OR LIABILITY FOR 
LOSSES WHICH MAY NOT BE LAWFULLY EXCLUDED OR LIMITED BY APPLICABLE LAW. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OR THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE CAUSED BY NEGLIGENCE,

12. Copyright and trade mark policies
12.1 It is Serotonin’s policy to respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with applicable 
international intellectual property law and to terminating the accounts of repeat infringers. 

13. Changes to the Terms
13.1 Serotonin may make changes to the Universal Terms or Additional Terms from time to time. When these changes are 
made, Serotonin will make a new copy of the terms available to you from within, or through, the affected Services.

13.2 You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Universal Terms or Additional 
Terms have changed, Serotonin will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Universal Terms or Additional Terms.

14. General legal terms
14.1 Sometimes when you use the Services, you may (as a result of, or in connection with your use of the Services) use 
a service or download a piece of software, or purchase goods, which are provided by another person or company. Your use 
of these other services, software or goods may be subject to separate terms between you and the company or person 
concerned. If so, the Terms do not affect your legal relationship with these other companies or individuals.

14.2 The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Serotonin and govern your use of the Services (but 
excluding any services which Serotonin may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace 
any prior agreements between you and Serotonin in relation to the Services.

14.3 You agree that Serotonin may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email, 
regular mail, or postings on the Services.

14.4 You agree that if Serotonin does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms 
(or which Serotonin has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of 
Serotonin’s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to Serotonin.

14.5 If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms is 
invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining 
provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.

14.6 You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which Serotonin is the parent shall be 
third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely 
upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other 
person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms.

14.7 The Terms, and your relationship with Serotonin under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the Province of
Ontario without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and Serotonin agree to submit to the exclusive 
jurisdiction of the courts located within the Town of Markham, Ontario to resolve any legal matter arising from the 
Terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that Serotonin shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an 
equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.

15. Additional Terms for Extensions for Mango Automation
15.1 These terms in this section apply if you install modules on your copy of Mango Automation. Modules are small 
software programs, developed by Serotonin or third parties, that can modify and enhance the functionality of Mango 
Automation. Modules may have greater privileges to access your computer, including the ability to read and modify your 
private data.

15.2 From time to time, Mango Automation may check with remote servers (hosted by Serotonin or by third parties) for 
available updates to modules, including but not limited to bug fixes or enhanced functionality.

15.3 From time to time, Serotonin may discover a module that violates Serotonin developer terms or other legal 
agreements, laws, regulations or policies. Mango Automation will periodically download a list of such modules from 
Serotonin’s servers. You agree that Serotonin may remotely disable or remove any such module from user systems in its 
sole discretion.

16. Additional Terms for Enterprise Use
16.1 If you are a business entity, then the individual accepting on behalf of the entity (for the avoidance of doubt, 
for business entities, in these Terms, "you" means the entity) represents and warrants that he or she has the authority 
to act on your behalf, that you represent that you are duly authorized to do business in the country or countries where 
you operate, and that your employees, officers, representatives, and other agents accessing the Service are duly 
authorized to access Mango Automation and to legally bind you to these Terms.

16.2 Subject to the Terms, and in addition to the license grant in Section 9, Serotonin grants you a non-exclusive, 
non-transferable license to reproduce, distribute, install, and use Mango Automation solely on machines intended for 
use by your employees, officers, representatives, and agents in connection with your business entity, and provided that 
their use of Mango Automation will be subject to the Terms.
